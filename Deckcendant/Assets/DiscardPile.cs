DISCARDPILE
The DiscardPile represents the set of cards that are unavailable to be drawn from at the start of the next turn. They are displayed in order. 

TODO:
- Create a method that gives a set amount of chosen cards to another pile(or hand)
- Create a method that gives a set amount of random cards to another pile(or hand)
- Create a method that takes a set amount of cards and adds it to the pile

TODO MUCH LATER:
- Create a method that displays the whole pile either randomized or not;
